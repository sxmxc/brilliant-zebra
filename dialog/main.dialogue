~ intro

: In the heart of the Trippy Dimension lies the planet Chromara, a world brimming with vibrant colors and harmonious balance. 
Chromara is a land of endless beauty, where rivers of light flow through forests of kaleidoscopic trees, and mountains shimmer with every hue imaginable. 
This harmony is maintained by the wise and benevolent Spectrum Sage, an ancient entity who channels the power of the colors to ensure peace and prosperity.

: But this tranquility was not always so.[do balloon_down()] 
[do action_fade_in()]Long ago, the Spectrum Sage created Chromara from the chaos of the Trippy Dimension, weaving together the threads of color to form a balanced and vibrant world. 
However, in the depths of this creation, a fragment of that original chaos was left behind, unnoticed.

: This fragment, a remnant of the primordial chaos, began to grow in power, feeding off the very harmony it sought to disrupt. 
Over time, it evolved into Fragmentum, a rogue glitch born from the unintended consequences of creation. 
Fragmentum's existence is fueled by a desire to undo the balance and return Chromara to a state of discord and entropy.

: Hidden in the shadows, Fragmentum bided his time, gathering strength and waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

~ scene_1
Spectrum Sage: Citizens of Chromara, gather close. 
Today, we celebrate the harmony of our world, a unity of colors that keeps our dimension in balance.

Fragmentum: Fools! 
Your precious harmony is a lie! 
I shall corrupt the Spectrum Sage and bring chaos to your world!

Bit: I won't let you destroy our home, Fragmentum. 
I will restore the Spectrum Sage and bring peace back to Chromara!

Fragmentum: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

Spectrum Sage: Bit, you are our last hope. 
You seem to be immune to the corruption, and that gives you the strength to combat Fragmentum. 
Seek out the fragments of my power scattered across Chromara. Restore them, and you will restore balance.

~ outro
: And so, Bit's quest begins. 
A journey through the vivid and treacherous landscapes of Chromara to gather the fragments of the Spectrum Sage's power, defeat Fragmentum, and restore harmony to the Trippy Dimension.
